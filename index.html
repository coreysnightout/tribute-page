          <h3>About Sketchy Tank</h3>
          <p>My name is Sketchy Tank. I’m an illustrator, designer, beer drinker, pot smoker, father, husband and swamp wizard. My art is definitely not for everyone, and that’s probably the point. Its mostly black and white, I like that high contrast mixed with disgusting shit, stuff that your parents wouldn’t like. Sketchy tank started as a folder on my computer called "the sketchy tank" where I stored disturbing images I found on the internet through various questionable blogs. These images were not disturbing like photos of outrageous porn or death and dismemberment but more like hideous tattoos, super trashy people doing trashy things, mixed with skateboarding, surfing and low brow art and design. The folder got to be over 1GB in size and I thought it would be rad to create a website to show the world this “sketchy tank” folder. I created a logo, bought the domain and posted away. It generated a lot of traffic quick. At the time I was a freelance designer/illustrator so I would slide my designs in there too. The views grew daily and I started offering shirts with my art for sale on sketchytank.com... the rest is history. I never thought it would turn into a brand and I still don't think of it like that, I like to think of it as the anti-brand, its just my weird art on stuff.</p>
